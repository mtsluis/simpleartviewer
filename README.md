# SimpleArtViewer

SimpleArtViewer searches for public domain artworks in the Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection, using the museum's public API.

**This project was developed only as a way to get familiar with Java**, so it was mostly a learning experience.
Some further development could add the following:

* Local user profiles, which allows the user to create an artwork library
* More terminal command options, replacing the current search/view artwork cycle
* Search filtering type (e.g., by artist, artwork title, artwork type), and eventually combine those.

## What it does
Quite simply, it searches the database for a given keyword and selecting an artwork will open the image file. Looking at paintings is nice.
