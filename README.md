# SimpleArtViewer

SimpleArtViewer searches for public domain artworks in the Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection, using the museum's public API.

This project was developed only as a way to get familiar with Java, so it was mostly a learning experiecence. I'll leave it open, since it was quite fun and simple to do and it might help a lost soul that eventually reaches here.

Further development could add the following:

* Local user profiles, which allows the user to create an artwork library
* Free terminal interaction, replacing the current search/view artwork cycle
* Possibility to choose the search type (e.g., by artist, artwork title, artwork type), and eventually combine those.
